`BUGFIX: Return first existing annotation, not "current" one <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2536>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases this error comes up:

    Trying to get property 'lazy' of non-object in ConfigurationBuilder

The reason for the error is the fact that the `current()` call does not return the existing annotation instance. The array pointer seems to point somewhere else. Using `reset()` instead of current solves the issue.

Using `reset()` does not really alter the (promised) behaviour of the method, so it is used instead.
