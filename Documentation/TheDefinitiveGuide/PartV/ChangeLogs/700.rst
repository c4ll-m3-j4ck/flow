* Packages: ``Flow``

`TASK: Print a helpful message, if autoload.php can not be found in CLI <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2283>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This adds a helpful message to the CLI output like this, if the Composer autoload file is mssing:

```
> ./flow
Composers autoload.php file was not found. The file is expected to be located in the path:

/Users/soren/Projects/flow-development-distribution/Packages/Framework/Neos.Flow/Scripts/../../../Libraries/autoload.php

This could be due to a missing 'config' => 'vendor-dir' section of your root 'composer.json' file.

The section key and value should look like the following
"vendor-dir": "Packages/Libraries"
Update your 'composer.json' file and run the 'composer update' command.
```

Resolves #2282 

* Packages: ``Flow``

`BUGFIX: Correct printed path for created doctrine migrations <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2297>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tweaks the output of the `doctrine:migrationgenerate` command so that it renders the path of the new migration relative to the root directory.

Before:

    The migration was moved to: Application/<Package.Key>/Migrations/<DB-Type>/Version<Version>.php

Now:

    The migration was moved to: Packages/Application/<Package.Key>/Migrations/<DB-Type>/Version<Version>.php

Fixes #2296 

* Packages: ``Flow``

`!!! TASK: Make composer autoloader the default <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2288>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The old behaviour can now still be achieved by setting `FLOW_ONLY_COMPOSER_LOADER=false`, but is (still) deprecated and will be gone at some point.

This is a breaking change if you relied on the old behavior, specifically on the fact that Flow used to consider all packages underneath the `/Packages` folder.

From now on, packages will only be loaded if they are properly installed via composer!

`TASK: Some psalm corrections <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2316>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This makes use of psalm specific docblock attributes for class-string types.
That tells Psalm to make sure that the value is always given a ::class constant

`TASK: Add core migration that warns about component chain usage <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2315>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Provides a minimal core migration that will show a warning
when the migrated package contains PHP code that refers to
the no longer existing `ComponentInterface`.

Usage:

    ./flow flow:core:migrate <Package-Key> --version 20201205172733

Example output:

```
Warnings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Following files refer to the ComponentInterface that has been removed
    with Flow 7.0:

    * Classes/Http/SomeComponent.php
    * Classes/Http/SomeOtherComponent.php

    The component chain was replaced with a middleware chain in Flow 7. Please make
    sure you have read the upgrade instructions and converted your components to
    middlewares.

`TASK: Revert "FEATURE: Easy injection of the active ServerRequest" <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2309>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This reverts #2144 which introduced a class `ActiveServerRequestProvider`
that allowed for easy injection of the active `ServerRequest`.

Background:

With the immutable nature of PSR-7 classes, the injected request might
not reflect the latest state and the behavior would depend on the
order in which the injection was executed.
With the HTTP middlewares chain ```Http\\RequestHandler::getHttpRequest()``
will always contain the "current" request.

`FEATURE: Middleware CLI command <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2307>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adds a CLI command `middleware:list` that can be used to list
all configured middleware components in the order they will be
executed.

`!!! BUGFIX: Relative position to non-existing key in PositionalArraySorter throws exception <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2214>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Until now, an element positioned relative to a non-existing key would just be skipped silently. With this, it will throw an exception to bring awareness to the "inactive" array element.

This is a breaking change because previously referring to a non existing position would be ignored.
For example:
```yaml
Neos:
  Flow:
    mvc:
      routes:
        'Some.Package':
          position: 'before Some.NonExistingPackage'
```
previously: The corresponding routes would be inserted according to the loading order (i.e. non-deterministic basically)
now: An `InvalidPositionException` exception is thrown:
```
The positional string "before Some.NonExistingPackage" (defined for key "Some.Package") references a non-existing key.
```

`!!! BUGFIX: Define default SAMESITE attribute to LAX <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2275>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The neos-ui complaining with warning in the modern browsers because our session cookie has no defined same site attribute and so the browser expect to have a same site with the lax value or none but with the secure attribute.

As the browsers use LAX as default we now also define that.
For mor information read https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite

Resolves: #2031

**What I did**
Define `SameSite=Lax` when no sameSite is defined.

**How to verify it**
Just load the neos backend and check the dev console for warning. There should be no warning regarding session cookies.

**Checklist**

- [x] Code follows the PSR-2 coding style
- [x] Tests have been created, run and adjusted as needed
- [ ] The PR is created against the [lowest maintained branch](https://www.neos.io/features/release-roadmap.html)

`BUGFIX: Fix UriConstraints::withPort() when port is equal to current port <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2276>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fixes the behavior of `UriConstraints` when using `withPort()` with
a (custom) port that is equal to the port of the applied URL:

```
UriConstraints::create()->withPort(8080)->applyTo(new Uri('http://localhost:8080'), true);
```

Now creates `http://localhost:8080` while it was `http://localhost` before.

`!!! TASK: Remove deprecated code <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2262>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Remove obsolete and deprecated PHP code:
* `Cli/Request::getMainRequest()` & `Cli/Request::isMainRequest()`
  * Those were deprecated with 6.0 (via #1552) and never really served a purpose since
    CLI requests can't be nested
* `Neos\\Flow\\Persistence\\Generic\\*`
  * Before we had doctrine, we had a custom persistence layer that was kept as "generic" persistence when we introduced doctrine ten years ago (via `90cb65827c1550e9144e9f83b9231b430c106660 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/90cb65827c1550e9144e9f83b9231b430c106660>`_). Since 6.0 this custom persistence was deprecated in favor of the corresponding `Neos\\Flow\\Persistence\\Doctrine\\*` classes.
    generic persistence is dead, long live generic persistence! (and thanks to @kdambekalns for spending million of minutes and brain cells on this)
* `Neos\\Flow\\Security\\Cryptography\\SaltedMd5HashingStrategy`
  * md5 is unsafe and the hashing strategy was deprecated with 6.0.
* `ObjectAccess::instantiateClass()`
  * deprecated with 5.3.16 (via #1972). With PHP 5.6+ `new $className(...$arguments)` can be used instead
* `HttpRequestHandlerInterface`/`HttpRequestHandler::getHttpResponse()`
  * deprecated with 6.0 (via #1755) and now gone. If you need the current HTTP Response, use a middleware, as the Response does not exist earlier at all

`FEATURE: Pass SignalInformation instance to slot if possible <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2216>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the new `wire()` method signal/slot connections use an instance of
`SignalInformation` as parameter for the called slot method.

Slots connected using `connect()` continue to receive a string argument
`EmitterClassName::signalName` like before, if requested.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is breaking in case you created your own ViewHelper that overrides the `registerArgument()` or `overrideArgument()` method. In that case you need to add a new boolean optional argument `$escape = null` and forward that to the parent method.

`BUGFIX: Fix default order of middleware components <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2261>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adjusts the order of the Middleware components so that
the `SessionMiddleware` is executed before the `RoutingMiddleware`.

Otherwise session based authentication won't work until the
routing middleware was executed.

This also removes most of the explicit `position` configurations
in order to avoid too much interdependency.

If a 3rd party middleware needs to be executed before/after another
one, it can still use `position: before/after <name>`  of course.
Depending on the order of _multiple_ other components is considered
bad practice. But if that's really required one could still add a
`position` setting to the existing middleware configuration.

`!!! TASK: Remove ComponentChain and ComponentContext <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2221>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Removes the HTTP Component chain implementation.

This is a breaking change because it removes the following classes:

* `Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Component\\ComponentInterface` (was part of the public API!)
* `Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Component\\Exception` (public API)
* `Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Component\\ComponentChain` (already deprecated)
* `Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Component\\ComponentChainFactory` (already deprecated)
* `Neos\\Flow\\Http\\Component\\ComponentContext` (already deprecated)

It also adjusts the `Neos\\Flow\\Http\\HttpRequestHandlerInterface` by removing the `getComponentContext()` method.
To get hold of the current HTTP request, use `HttpRequestHandlerInterface::getHttpRequest()` which is no longer deprecated.
`HttpRequestHandlerInterface::getHttpResponse()` is still deprecated. Use a middleware component to get hold
of the current HTTP response. But usually that shouldn't be required anyways. Instead you can alter the final HTTP
response via `$this->response` in ActionControllers.

`!!! TASK: Update Doctrine Migrations to 3.0 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1880>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This updated the required version of `doctrine/migrations` from 1.8 to 3.0.

While there are new features in Doctrine Migrations, the reason for us to do
an upgrade is to move forward – the previously used version will not be
maintained forever… This post also gives some background on that:
https://www.doctrine-project.org/2020/04/10/doctrine-migrations-3.0.html

For a Flow user the commands remain unchanged, so far no multi-namespace
migrations are supported and the features to the "official" CLI do not matter,
since we embed the functionality in our own commands.

**Breaking changes**

There are three things that make this upgrade a breaking change:

- `Doctrine\\DBAL\\Migrations` moved to `Doctrine\\Migrations`
- `AbstractMigration` changed method signatures (type delcarations added)

To adjust your PHP code (the migration files), a core migration is provided that
should fix the vast majority of existing migrations. (That core migration is in Flow
and named `Version20201109224100`.)

- The "version" is the FQCN of the migration class (existing entries in the migrations table will be automatically updated)

The needed changes to the DB table where the migration status is stored are done
the first time a command that accesses that table is used. Make sure to have a current
backup and then run `./flow doctrine:migrationstatus --show-migrations`. If all
went well, the migrations should all be listed as a fully-qualified class name, no
longer just a date/time string. If any errors occurred during the command, restore the
backup (the migrations table is sufficient), fix the errors and try again.

See https://github.com/doctrine/migrations/blob/3.0.x/UPGRADE.md#code-bc-breaks
and https://github.com/doctrine/migrations/blob/3.0.x/UPGRADE.md#upgrade-to-20
for a full list of other changes. Most of those are wrapped in Flow code and need no
adjustments in userland code.
