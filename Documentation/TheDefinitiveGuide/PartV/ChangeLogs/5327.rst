`TASK: Revert #2052 - Add TTL to tags in RedisBackend <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2516>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This resolves the issues with the redis backend that came up after the changes in #2052, which unfortunately are worse than the benefits. We'd still like to get the TTL for tags in, but likely need to refrain from having them consistent/in sync.
