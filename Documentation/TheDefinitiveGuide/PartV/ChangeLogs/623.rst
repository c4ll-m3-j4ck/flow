`BUGFIX: Correct indention for throwables config <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2081>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The configuration of the throwable exceptions should not be part of the `psr3` level. And the default config did not work since 6.0. The method `initializeExceptionStorage` still expects the configuration to be at the path `Neos.Flow.log.throwables`.

Fixes: #2082

`!!! BUGFIX: Browser arguments are the request parsed body <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2050>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since 6.0 the Browser `$arguments` were accidentially moved to the request query parameters, while they should reflect the post body arguments.

The docblock even states that:
`@param array $arguments Arguments to send in the request body`

**Note**: this slightly changes behaviour if you adapted your usage of Browser since 6.0.0. If you want to send query parameters, you should instead provide an `Uri` instance with the parameters, as was already the case prior to 6.0. (This is the reason for marking this bugfix as breaking.)
