`BUGFIX: No usage of dynamic properties <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3032>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This patch resolves deprecation notices on PHP 8.2:

## Dynamic properties in proxy classes
There are some properties that are dynamically declared in proxy classes:
* ``Flow_Injected_Properties``
* ``Flow_Object_PropertiesToSerialize``
* ``Flow_Persistence_RelatedEntities``: this is mostly used inside of the ``ObjectSerializationTrait``, so I thought it might make more sense to declare it there instead of adding a property using the ``ProxyClassBuilder``

* Resolves: `#2946 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/2946>`_

## ``parent`` inside of closures
There are some methods that will be checked against ``is_callable`` with ``parent::``:
* ``parent::Flow_Aop_Proxy_buildMethodsAndAdvicesArray``
* ``parent::__wakeup``

**Review instructions**

`BUGFIX: Fix proxy compilation for edge cases <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2624>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This change fixes proxy compilation for certain cases where "class"
was used as a string in multi-line quoted strings or within comments.

* Resolves: `#1835 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/1835>`_

`TASK: Require all collection packages as `self.version` <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3035>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any dependency from one package in the collection to another should always be "to the same version".

This changes makes sure this is the case by using ``self.version`` as the required version.

See `#3034 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/3034>`_
